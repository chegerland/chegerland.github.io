  abstract = {We investigate the dispersion relations of TE resonances in different graphene-dielectric structures. Previous work has shown that when a graphene layer is brought into contact with a dielectric material, a gap can appear in its electric band structure. This allows for the formation of TE-plasmons with unusual dispersion relations. In addition, if the dielectric has a finite thickness, graphene strongly modifies the behavior of the waveguiding modes by introducing dissipation above a well-defined cutoff frequency, thus providing the possibility of mode filtering. This cutoff and the properties of TE-plasmons are closely related to the pair-creation threshold of graphene, thus representing quantum mechanical effects that manifest themselves in the electromagnetic response.},

It is used to determine the total force exerted on the membrane at each position along the leading edge and at each time step. The model reproduces the marked state switches in protrusion morphodynamics found experimentally between epithelial cells in control conditions and cells expressing constitutively active Rac, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of lamellipodium network assembly. The model also suggests a mechanistic explanation of experimental distortions in protrusion morphodynamics induced by deregulation of Arp2/3 and cofilin activity.},

  abstract = {Motile cells form lamellipodia in the direction of motion, which are flat membrane protrusions containing an actin filament network. The network flows rearward relative to the leading edge of the lamellipodium due to actin polymerization at the front. Thus, actin binding molecules are subject to transport towards the rear of the cell in the bound state and diffuse freely in the unbound state. We analyze this reaction\textendash{}diffusion\textendash{}advection process with respect to the concentration profiles of these species and provide an analytic approximation for them. Network flow may cause a depletion zone of actin binding molecules close to the leading edge. The existence of such zone depends on the free molecule concentration in the cell body, on the ratio of the diffusion length to the distance bound molecules travel rearward with the flow before dissociating, and the ratio of the diffusion length to the width of the region with network flow and actin binding. Our calculations suggest the existence of depletion zones for the F-actin cross-linkers filamin and $\alpha$-actinin in fish keratocytes (and other cell types), which is in line with the small elastic moduli of the F-actin network close to the leading edge found in measurements of the force motile cells are able to exert.},

Mortality was 28.1\% (475/1691) in the intervention group and 30.2\% (514/1702) in the control group (P for difference=0.4).

  abstract = {To examine the association between Quran memorization and health among older men. This cross-sectional study included older Saudi men (age $\geq$ 55 years) from Buraidah, Al-Qassim. The neighborhoods were selected randomly (20 out of 96); eligible men from the mosques were recruited. Demographics, lifestyle, and depression were assessed with standardized questionnaires; height, weight, blood pressure, and random blood glucose (glucometer) were measured with standard protocol. The mean and standard deviation for age, body mass index, and Quran memorization were 63 years (7.5), 28.9 kg/m (4.8), and 4.3 sections (6.9). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and depression were 71\%, 29\%, and 22\%, respectively. Those who memorized at least 10 sections of Quran were 64\%, 71\%, and 81\% less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and depression compared to those who memorized less than 0.5 sections, after controlling for covariates. There was a strong linear association between Quran memorization and hypertension, diabetes, and depression indicating that those who had memorized a larger portion of the Quran were less likely to have one of these chronic diseases. Future studies should explore the potential health benefits of Quran memorization and the underlying mechanisms.},

After introducing the framework, we highlight its features and showcase implementations of generic quantum models. Finally, we compare its usability and performance to two well-established and widely used numerical quantum libraries.

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The popular bar prank known in colloquial English as beer tapping consists in hitting the top of a beer bottle with a solid object, usually another bottle, to trigger the foaming over of the former within a few seconds. Despite the trick being known for long time, to the best of our knowledge, the phenomenon still lacks scientific explanation. Although it seems natural to think that shock-induced cavitation enhances the diffusion of CO\$\_2\$ from the supersaturated bulk liquid into the bubbles by breaking them up, the subtle mechanism by which this happens remains unknown. Here we show that the overall foaming-over process can be divided into three stages where different physical phenomena take place in different time-scales, namely: bubble-collapse (or cavitation) stage, diffusion-driven stage and buoyancy-driven stage. In the bubble-collapse stage, the impact generates a train of expansion-compression waves in the liquid that leads to the fragmentation of pre-existing gas cavities. Upon bubble fragmentation, the sudden increase of the interface-area-to-volume ratio enhances mass transfer significantly, which makes the bubble volume grow by a large factor until CO\$\_2\$ is locally depleted. At that point buoyancy takes over, making the bubble clouds rise and eventually form buoyant vortex rings whose volume grows fast due to the feedback between the buoyancy-induced rising speed and the advection-enhanced CO\$\_2\$ transport from the bulk liquid to the bubble. The physics behind this explosive process might also be connected to some geological phenomena.},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevA.98.013849},
  abstract = {We consider the energy transfer process between two identical atoms placed inside a perfectly conducting cylindrical waveguide. We first introduce a general analytical expression of the energy transfer amplitude in terms of the electromagnetic Green's tensor; we then evaluate it in the case of a cylindrical waveguide made of a perfect conductor, for which analytical expressions of the Green's tensor exist. We numerically analyze the energy transfer amplitude when the radius of the waveguide is such that the transition frequency of both atoms is below the lower cutoff frequency of the waveguide, so that the resonant photon exchange is strongly suppressed. We consider both cases of atomic dipoles parallel and orthogonal to the axis of the guide. In both cases, we find that the energy transfer is modified by the presence of the waveguide. In the near zone, that is when the atomic separation is smaller than the atomic transition wavelength, the change, with respect to the free-space case, is small for axial dipoles, while it is larger for radial dipoles; it grows when the intermediate region between near and far zone is approached. In the far zone, we find that the energy transfer amplitude is strongly suppressed by the waveguide, becoming virtually zero. A physical interpretation of these results is discussed. Finally, we discuss the resonance interaction energy and force between two identical correlated atoms in the waveguide, one excited and the other in the ground state, prepared in their symmetric or antisymmetric superposition.},

Any modification of the environment in which those photons propagate will thus invariably lead to an alteration of the van der Waals interaction. Here we show how the two-body dispersion interaction inside a cylindrical waveguide can be made to decay asymptotically exponentially and how this effect sensitively depends on the material properties and the length scales of the problem, eventually leading to the possibility of controllable interactions. Further, we discuss the possibility to detect the retarded van der Waals interaction by resonant enhancement of the interaction between Rydberg atoms in the light of long-range potentials due to guided modes.},

After reviewing the main properties of surface waves, we introduce the fluctuation\textendash{}dissipation theorem that allows to model the fluctuating electromagnetic fields. We then analyse the contribution of these waves in a variety of phenomena. They give a leading contribution to the density of electromagnetic states, they produce both temporal coherence and spatial coherence in the near field of planar thermal sources. They can be used to modify radiative properties of surfaces and to design partially spatially coherent sources. Finally, we discuss the role of surface waves in the radiative heat transfer and the theory of dispersion forces at the subwavelength scale.},

  abstract = {In this review we look at the concepts and state-of-the-art concerning the strong coupling of surface plasmon-polariton modes to states associated with quantum emitters such as excitons in J-aggregates, dye molecules and quantum dots. We explore the phenomenon of strong coupling with reference to a number of examples involving electromagnetic fields and matter. We then provide a concise description of the relevant background physics of surface plasmon polaritons. An extensive overview of the historical background and a detailed discussion of more recent relevant experimental advances concerning strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and quantum emitters is then presented. Three conceptual frameworks are then discussed and compared in depth: classical, semi-classical and fully quantum mechanical; these theoretical frameworks will have relevance to strong coupling beyond that involving surface plasmon polaritons. We conclude our review with a perspective on the future of this rapidly emerging field, one we are sure will grow to encompass more intriguing physics and will develop in scope to be of relevance to other areas of science.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations have observable consequences, like the Casimir force between mirrors in vacuum. This force is now measured with good accuracy and agreement with theory when the effect of imperfect reflection of mirrors is properly taken into account. We discuss the simple case of bulk metallic mirrors described by a plasma model and show that simple scaling laws are obtained at the limits of long and short distances. The crossover between the short and long-distance laws is quite similar to the crossover between Van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces for two atoms in vacuum. The result obtained at short distances can be understood as the London interaction between plasmon excitations at the surface of each bulk mirror.},
